# TTGO-LoRa32-V2.1-TTN (version T3_v1.6 20180606)

TTGO LoRa32 V2.1 Sketch for TTN (The Things Network)

This sketch has al the needed components to connect the board to The Things Network. I found a few sketches online based on the paxcounter but I didn't find it lean and mean. This sketch has also support for the oled display wich you can adjust to your needs.

It has LoRaWAN support fot OTAA and ABP activation.

You can edit the credentias.h file with your OTAA or ABP keys. You can use the sensor tab to fill the payload with data of a sensor of your own. The payload is now set to 11 for testing purposes.
